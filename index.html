    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Halal Finder</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”). Your privacy is important to us. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application <strong>Halal Finder – Food Scanner</strong> handles, protects, and uses information when you use it. By installing or using the app, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data Required:</strong> We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information such as your name, email address, or precise location to use the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The app requests access to your device camera solely to scan product barcodes. No images, photos, videos, or biometric data are stored or transmitted by us.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> The app may connect to trusted online sources to retrieve product information and halal status. We do not collect personal identifiers from these requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Identifier (Ad ID):</strong> Third‑party advertising or analytics SDKs (for example, Google AdMob) integrated into the app may collect device identifiers (such as Advertising ID), IP address, and other non‑identifiable device information to serve and measure ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data:</strong> We may collect basic, non‑identifiable analytics (e.g., app version, device model, crash logs) to improve app performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We process barcode data locally on your device to identify food products and display halal classification results (Halal, Haram, or Doubtful). We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose personal information for commercial purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>Our app displays ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and may use analytics services such as Firebase. These third‑party services may collect and use non‑personal device information to provide, personalize, and measure advertising.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Learn more about how Google uses data: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Partner‑Sites Policy</a></li>
      <li>Manage or opt out of personalized ads: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="small-note">Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom will be shown a consent form via Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to choose whether to receive personalized ads.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Because we do not collect personal information, security risks are reduced; however, we follow best practices for data protection.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the app, please contact us and we will promptly delete such information.</p>

    <h2>6. Health and Religious Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Halal Finder provides informational guidance about the halal status of products based on publicly available ingredient data and databases. It is <strong>not affiliated with or certified by any official halal certification authority</strong> and should not be relied upon as a substitute for official certification or professional advice.</p>

    <h2>7. Links to Third‑Party Sites and Services</h2>
    <p>The app may contain links to third‑party websites, ads, or services. These third parties have their own privacy policies and practices, and we are not responsible for their content or data handling. Please review those policies before providing information.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can opt out of personalized ads by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a> or by adjusting your device ad preferences.</li>
      <li>You can disable camera permission at any time in your device settings; barcode scanning features will cease to function if disabled.</li>
      <li>You may uninstall the app at any time to stop all app‑related data processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
