    <h1>Privacy Policy for HalalFinder – Food Scanner</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 13, 2025</p>

    <p>HalalScan ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile application, <strong>HalalScan – Halal Food Identifier</strong> ("the App"), handles data and protects your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data Required:</strong> We do not require account creation, name, or contact information.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The app uses your device camera solely to scan product barcodes. No photos or videos are saved or transmitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> The app may retrieve product data from public databases such as Open Food Facts. No personal identifiers are sent with these requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The scanned barcode data is processed locally or with public APIs to display halal classification results (Halal, Haram, Doubtful) and product ingredients. This information is used only for displaying results within the app.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal data. Any product data is cached locally on your device for faster use and never uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party services such as Open Food Facts API, which have their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Health Information Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>HalalScan provides religious and informational guidance by identifying halal or haram food products. It does not provide medical, nutritional, or dietary advice and is not intended for diagnosing, treating, or monitoring health conditions.</p>

Learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>
    <p>Anonymous analytics tools (like Firebase Analytics) may be used to understand app performance. These do not include personally identifiable data.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is safe for all ages and does not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera use is optional; manual barcode entry is available.</li>
      <li>You can manage ad personalization in your device settings or Google’s Ads Settings page.</li>
    </ul>
